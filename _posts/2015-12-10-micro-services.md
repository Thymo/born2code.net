This week I spoke at the [GOTO Night: It's Not Just MicroServices](http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2016/freeevent/index.jsp?eventOID=7370) alongside with Fred George. It was great to finally meet Fred in person and I enjoyed discussing my journey with him.

There was an amazing atmospehere that evening. Many ad hoc discussions before, during and after the talk and that is exactly the way I like it. That is why I prefer speaking at smaller events. Speaker and audience seem to be more connected.
