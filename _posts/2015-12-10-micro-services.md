This week I spoke at the [GOTO Night: It's Not Just MicroServices](http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2016/freeevent/index.jsp?eventOID=7370) alongside with Fred George. It was great to finally meet Fred in person. It was great to discuss my journey with him.

There was an amazing atmospehere that evening. Many ad hoc discussions, even during the talk and that is exactly the way I like it. That is why I usually prefer speaking at smaller events. Speaker and audience seem to be much more connected.
