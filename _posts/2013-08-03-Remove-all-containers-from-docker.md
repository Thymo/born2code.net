[Docker](http://docker.io) is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container. It gives you the power to create lightweight self sufficient containers and even provides some versioning for all the changes you make. See it as a git repository for your containers that holds all the changes you make. Just like git, it saved my ass numberious times. But all this versioning power comes with a price and sometimes I feel the need to clean up my docker container environment. Currently docker does not provide an easy way to clean up your container environment. There has been some talk on Github about a docker clean command. If you are interested I suggest you to watch this issue: [Implement a 'clean' command](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/928). Until this issues has been fixed and a proper clean command is introduced, you can use this command to clean up all your containers:

    # WARNING: This will remove all your docker containers!
    docker ps -a | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm
