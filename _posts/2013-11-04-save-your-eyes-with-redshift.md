title: "Tune your biological clock with Redshift"
---

I recently started using [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/)
and now I question myself how I ever looked into that bright illuminated screen all the time?

Redshift adjusts the color temperature your screen based on the position of
the sun. When there is no sun because it is too early or too late it tries to match
the color temperature of the lamps there room.

The thing that surprised me is that not only it alleviates the strain on my eyes,
but that the slow transition of color temperature make me more aware of the time of the day.
When my screen is pretty bright - normal color temperature - I know it is time to
lunch. I know it is almost time to get ready for my trip to home when everything
starts to look warm. Also the deep red tone during the evening gets makes me aware
that I am hacking at night, rather than the I am just hacking. It is hard to
explain this, but when I talked to one of my colleagues today, that was his
experience as well.

It makes you better aware of time without the explicit numbers
a clock offers. And a clock jumps from time to time. We have all been there where
you look at the clock, and the next time you look a few hours past. I guess that
Redshift is some sort of clock that you can't miss. Maybe that is the reason
that is [can also help you sleep better](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/05/13/sleep.gadgets.ipad/index.html).

A pleasant surprise from a tool that I thought would __just__ save my eyes.

Although [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) works on Linux and Windows,
I think people that want to try this on Windows or Mac OS are better of 
with [f.lux](http://justgetflux.com/).
