Hi, my name is __Pieter Joost van de Sande__ and I’m a __software engineer__ for almost a decade.

I'm currently employed by [wercker](http://wercker.com), a startup based in Amsterdam. We are building an integral software delivery platform in the cloud. At wercker I mainly write NodeJS, Python, Go and Shell Script. Next to writing code I'm responsible for community engagement and support.
Previously I was a thought leader at [atos](http://atos.net/), one of worlds leading international information technology services companies. This is where I received the Atos TRP award and therefor I was a [distinguished member of technical staff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_technical_staff).

Next to the employment I play an active role in the software development community. I've presented at conferences like Microsoft TechDays, Software Development Conference and NDC. I'm a one of the founders of [Devnology](http://devnology.nl) and I help to organise meetings and run a [software development podcast](http://devnology.nl/en/podcast). My active role in the community is recognised by Microsoft who awarded me with the exclusive [Microsoft MVP](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/default.aspx) award.

In my free time I contribute to various open source projects. I have contributed to [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), [ncqrs](http://github.com/ncqrs/ncqrs), [node-auth](https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth), [ssh-keygen](https://github.com/ericvicenti/ssh-keygen), [Neo4jClient](https://bitbucket.org/Readify/neo4jclient), [EventStore](https://github.com/joliver/EventStore) and [many more](https://github.com/pjvds). As you can see at my [Github profile](https://github.com/pjvds), the  contributions are not bound to a specific programming language or platform. I like to explore different languages and paradigms. I am  count [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa287558.aspx) as one of worlds most beautiful programming languages, and I am in love with [Google's Go](http://golang.org). Although I prefer staticly typed languages in most situations, you also find me writing [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript), [Python](http://www.python.org/), some [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Smalltalk](http://smalltalk.org).

To clear my head and recharge my batteries I run [barefoot](http://barefootrunning.com).

## Contact

If you have any questions, comments, or would just like to say hello, please don't hesitate to [drop me a tweet](http://twitter.com/pjvds), send me a mail [pj@born2code.net](mailto:pj@born2code.net).

## Colophon

The reason this website looks awesome is [David Ensinger](http://davidensinger.com/). I used his site design as the foundation for this one. I develop mainly on a [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) (can't live without a retina display anymore) that runs [Ubuntu 13.10](http://ubuntu.com) with [AwesomeWM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), a [tailing window manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager). [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is my primarily editor. Type is set in [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans), which is served by [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts). Posts are composed in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and syntax is highlighted with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

The site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Amazone S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The process of generation and deployment is automated with [wercker](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/c38587366b136b180eb7108c9c250cdc).

The DNS for [born2code.net](http://born2code.net) is served by [Amazon Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/‎), Amazon's high available and scalable domain name system. This allows me to host this blog at a naked domain (a domain without www).

The source code is hosted at [github](http://github.com) in the repository [pjvds/born2code](http://github.com/pjvds/born2code). You are free to fork or steel anything you find useful.
